# Week 2 Notes

## Few Novel Questions

#1. Does training or genetics have a larger effect on cardiovascular endurance/health?
Feedback: It is a very compelling idea of "naturs vs nurture", however there might
be a problem of available data, you would need: genetic data + training history + health metrics.
This would probably be an extensive project where the are many factors and unknown variables.


#2. What is the biggest predictor of a defult on a loan that can be tracked?
Feedback: What is nice about this question is that it is very practical and is very well documented
in finance. This would be great to run as a logistic regression. But the question could be asked more specific like: 
"For this specific demographic and variables, which best predicts default?".


#3. Does adolescent work (especially 18-22 years old) have an effect on long-term financial success?
Feedback: Very interesting and can be done with Panel data to be tracked. This however requires long-term data
and there could be a very low r-squared in a regression due to there being so many unexplained variables over the 
long period of time


#4. Does religious church attendance effect life-span or overall health?
Feedback: Facinating topic on scocioligy and health. Could use surveys + health datasets. The problem that could occur
would be that religion data is self-reported and could be a result of correlation and no causation.


#5. What major gives you the best risk for reward of long-term income?
Feedback: Very applicable question for where I am at and is a good question to ask . There are many datasets from
graduates that answer this question. I would need ot better define risk and what factors to include in the best overall
You could use some type of formula or equation to factor return and risk together.
